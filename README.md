# Food App
## Objective
- create a pinterest like app, only just for things that make you hungry.

## Plans for the future
- include a 'like' and 'dislike' feature where users can like and dislike posts. 
- include a link (client routing) on each card such that clicking it will lead to more info on the foods
- route the form to a separate page
- refactor the FoodForm component so that it can be used for the DessertsContainer


## Steps to start up the app
- run the command 'json-server --watch db.json' to get server running.
- run command 'npm start' to start the app.
